## Take-Home Assignment: Automated Testing for Angular Todo List Application
### Objective:
Develop and implement a comprehensive suite of automated tests for an Angular-based todo list application that you will create by following a detailed tutorial. This exercise will assess your ability to work with Angular, write tests, and document your findings.

### Assignment Details:

**1. Application Setup:** 
- Follow the MDN tutorial to create a simple todo list application using Angular. This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on setting up the environment and developing the application. Start here: [Angular Todo List Tutorial on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Angular_todo_list_beginning).
- Ensure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed on your machine. Instructions for these are included in the tutorial.

**2. Tasks:**

- **Develop the Application:** Build the todo list application as guided by the tutorial. Make sure to understand each part of the application as you will need to write tests for these components.
- **Write Unit Tests:** Create unit tests for the application components using Angular's testing framework, focusing on isolated testing of methods and component interactions.
- **Write Integration Tests:** Develop integration tests that check the interaction between components and services, especially focusing on the application's ability to manage state correctly when todos are added or removed.
- **Write End-to-End Tests:** Utilize a tool like Protractor to implement end-to-end tests that simulate user interactions with the application.

**3. Documentation:**

- **Bug Report:** Document any bugs or issues you find during development or testing in a structured bug report.
- **Testing Documentation:** Provide a README file that includes:
  - Instructions on how to set up and run your tests.
  - A summary of your testing strategy and any tools used.
  - Descriptions of any significant bugs or issues found, along with their potential impact.

**4. Submission:**

- Push your completed project, including all test files and documentation, to a GitHub repository.
- Email the repository link to the hiring manager for review.


### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Completeness:** How well does the application follow the tutorial and fulfill the functionality?
- **Quality of Testing:** Are the tests thorough and do they cover different scenarios including edge cases?
- **Documentation:** Clarity and detail in the bug reports and test documentation.
- **Problem Solving:** Effectiveness in identifying and documenting issues.
